# FCND - 3D Motion Planning
![Quad Image](./misc/enroute.png)



This project is a continuation of the Backyard Flyer project where I executed a simple square shaped flight path. In this project I have integrated the techniques that I have learned throughout the lessons to plan a path through an urban environment. Check out the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1534/view) for more detail on what constitutes are implimented in this project.

## To run this project on your local machine, follow these instructions:
### Step 1: Download the Simulator
This is a new simulator environment!  

Download the Motion-Planning simulator for this project that's appropriate for your operating system from the [simulator releases respository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).

### Step 2: Set up your Python Environment
Set up your Python environment and get all the relevant packages installed using Anaconda following instructions in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

### Step 3: Clone this Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Ashutosh-Badave/UAV_Motion_Planning
```
### Step 4: Test setup
First test the [solution code](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/backyard_flyer_solution.py) for the Backyard Flyer project in this simulator. Verify that Backyard Flyer code works as expected and drone can perform the square flight path in the this simulator. To do this, start the simulator and run the [`backyard_flyer_solution.py`](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Motion-Planning/blob/master/backyard_flyer_solution.py) script.

```sh
source activate fcnd # if you haven't already sourced your Python environment, do so now.
python backyard_flyer_solution.py
```
The quad should take off, fly a square pattern and land, just as in the previous project. If everything functions as expected then you are ready to fly the drone using motion planning.

### Step 5: Inspect the relevant files
In this project, two scripts are provided, `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`. Here you'll also find a file called `colliders.csv`, which contains the 2.5D map of the simulator environment. 

### Step 6: Test  `motion_planning.py` and `planning_utils.py`

`motion_planning.py` is basically a modified version of `backyard_flyer.py` that leverages some extra functions in `planning_utils.py`. It should work right out of the box.  Try running `motion_planning.py` to see what it does. To do this, first start up the simulator, then at the command line:
 
```sh
source activate fcnd # if you haven't already sourced your Python environment, do so now.
python motion_planning.py
```

You should see the quad fly path of waypoints to the northeast for about 100 m then land.  What's going on here? 

### Step 7: How Planner works

Planning algorithm looks like the following:

- Loads the 2.5D map in the `colliders.csv` file describing the environment.
- Discretizes the environment into a grid or graph representation.
- Defines the start and goal locations. You can determine your home location from `self._latitude` and `self._longitude`. 
- Performs a search using A* search algorithm. 
- Uses a collinearity test to remove unnecessary waypoints. Also ray tracing method (like Bresenham) is implemented, just change pronning path method.
- Return waypoints in local ECEF coordinates (format for `self.all_waypoints` is [N, E, altitude, heading], where the droneâ€™s start location corresponds to [0, 0, 0, 0]). 

### Step 8: Check out the writup!
Detailed writeup of this project and how I addressed each step of motion planning is mentioned in [`writeup_template.md`](./writeup_template.md).

## Challenges
If you feel inspired to take this project above and beyond, then here are some suggestions for interesting things to try.

### Try flying more complex trajectories
In this project, things are set up nicely to fly right-angled trajectories, where you ascend to a particular altitude, fly a path at that fixed altitude, then land vertically. However, you have the capability to send 3D waypoints and in principle you could fly any trajectory you like. Rather than simply setting a target altitude, try sending altitude with each waypoint and set your goal location on top of a building!

### Adjust your deadbands
Adjust the size of the deadbands around your waypoints, and even try making deadbands a function of velocity. To do this, you can simply modify the logic in the `local_position_callback()` function.

### Add heading commands to your waypoints
This is a recent update! Make sure you have the [latest version of the simulator](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases). In the default setup, you're sending waypoints made up of NED position and heading with heading set to 0 in the default setup. Try passing a unique heading with each waypoint. If, for example, you want to send a heading to point to the next waypoint, it might look like this:

```python
# Define two waypoints with heading = 0 for both
wp1 = [n1, e1, a1, 0]
wp2 = [n2, e2, a2, 0]
# Set heading of wp2 based on relative position to wp1
wp2[3] = np.arctan2((wp2[1]-wp1[1]), (wp2[0]-wp1[0]))
```

This may not be completely intuitive, but this will yield a yaw angle that is positive counterclockwise about a z-axis (down) axis that points downward.

Put all of these together and make up your own crazy paths to fly! Happy flying...!!!
